Hello everybody
In this short video I will show you how to

2
00:00:04.084 --> 00:00:09.095
use
the attributes that come with the video and

3
00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:15.097
audio elements
So... we will start in a JS Bin...

4
00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:20.366
In order to embed a video, you first start
by

5
00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:29.264
adding a video element to your web page
Usually, what we do is that we first

6
00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.370
provide a small message or maybe some links
to download the in case the browser

7
00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:42.566
does not support the video element.
So we write "your browser does not support

8
00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.940
the video
element, please download the video at...".

9
00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:55.943
I will add the link later.
One of the simplest way to embed a video is

10
00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.825
to use
the src attribute with a URL.

11
00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.730
I'm just using a URL I prepared...ok, like
that!

12
00:01:07.073 --> 00:01:13.080
You can see that the video... there is an
area

13
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.085
...black... that appeared here, on the right
(of the screen)

14
00:01:17.057 --> 00:01:24.108
I'm adding "controls", this is a boolean attribute.
It's true if it's present, or if it's not

15
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:30.060
empty, tou can type in anything here... and
it's false if it's omitted.

16
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:34.011
I omit it and the control bar disappears.
I prefer to use it

17
00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:39.081
without any value, like that...
I can play the video, you see...

18
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:44.167
I'm using Google Chrome and the mp4 format
for

19
00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:48.130
the video, that is one of the the most popular
and

20
00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:55.025
the best supported today.
But it's always better, and it's a best practice,

21
00:01:55.052 --> 00:02:03.100
to provide different encodings for the video.In
that case, do not use the src . Instead, provide,

22
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.093
using the source element, different encodings
for your videos.

23
00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:15.124
This is a good practice... now I propose the
video

24
00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:23.043
in webm, ogg andin mp4 formats.
The browser will choose the one it prefers.

25
00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:30.099
Either the first one it can play, or
the one than, in its opinion, has the best

26
00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.173
results.
So, here, now I don't know exactly which one

27
00:02:35.073 --> 00:02:39.079
is
played, but I'm pretty sure I will target

28
00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:46.111
many more
browsers than with only a single encoding.

29
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:54.017
What are the other attributes ?
I can specifythe width and the height

30
00:02:54.017 --> 00:03:01.068
In that case I've got a very small video,
100 pixels width and height,

31
00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:05.104
Other attributes that are interesting... there
is the

32
00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:11.008
preload attribute. You can see that the video
started downloading here...

33
00:03:11.044 --> 00:03:17.117
and that the black square corresponds to the
default size of the video. We call the size

34
00:03:18.017 --> 00:03:23.070
"metadata". This is the buffer
that is filling up.

35
00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:30.104
So, if I'm using preload="none",in that case
it asks

36
00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:35.113
the browser to do nothing,not to start preloading
the video,

37
00:03:36.013 --> 00:03:41.016
not preloading metadata...
This is the recommended value for mobile devices,

38
00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:48.049
or for web sites that have a lot of videos,
and you don't want them to preload.

39
00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:55.378
If you type in "metadata", this is another
possible value... in that case the video

40
00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.310
is not preloading but the size of the video,
the encoding

41
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:05.320
and other metadata have been downloaded so
that the player

42
00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:16.655
can have a reserved size on the page...
I recommend using the default value if you

43
00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.237
are targeting
desktops, or preload="none"...

44
00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.015
Another attribute that is not recommended
for mobile

45
00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:29.711
devices is autoplay In that case the video
starts being

46
00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:39.823
played as soon as the buffer has got enough
data.Another attribute is loop.It's self explanatory.

47
00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:46.232
If you go to$
the end of the video, it will loop.

48
00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:53.460
You saw the mostuseful attributes...Another
one that I

49
00:04:53.046 --> 00:05:00.495
recommend, in order to avoid this black square,
is the poster attribute. You type in poster

50
00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.110
equals
and you can add the URL of an image.

51
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:07.033
I uploaded an image, a screenshot of this
video,

52
00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:14.682
to the imgur web site.
Like this... we get a preview of the video

53
00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:23.580
Notice that Internet Explorer does not recognize
URLs here. It always chooses the first fram

54
00:05:23.058 --> 00:05:27.707
of the video
It's a bit of a problem, so if you don't want

55
00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.297
this behavior,
you will need to use a custom player or follow

56
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.994
the links
to the articles Ian Devlin wrote, where he

57
00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:44.765
explains how
to this behavior in Internet Explorer using

58
00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:52.831
some JavaScript.
That's all for this video, I hope you enjoyed

59
00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.968
it, the rest
of the page is a textual reference to all

60
00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.297
the attributes.
